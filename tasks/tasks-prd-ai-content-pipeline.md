### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `pytest` for backend Python tests: `cd apps/backend && poetry run pytest`
- Use `jest` for frontend tests: `cd apps/frontend && pnpm test`
- Integration tests should verify API endpoints and database operations
- Follow TDD methodology: write tests first, then implement functionality
